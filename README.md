# stats

Scraping match data from floorball-matches played in Ã˜stlandsserien (where I play)
Should be easily adjusted to different leagues.

Mapping json-data to objects such as Season, Match, MatchEvents and Player to find statistics for single players and overall statistics for teams.

Can: 
- Print league tables and player statistics. 
- Plot players and team scoring progression throughout the season.
- Plots timestamps for match-events such as goals and penalties. Can find patterns in when you score and concede goals. 

A bit messy structure. To be cleaned up some beautiful day...
